# Analyzing the Impact of Sea Surface Temperature on Southeast Asian Fisheries Production using Gaussian Hidden Markov Models

This study examines the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) on the capture production of key marine species in Southeast Asia from 2003 to 2022. Using a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) and Welch’s t-test, the analysis identifies species significantly affected by SST variations and forecasts future capture production trends. The dataset includes marine species capture production data from FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Statistics, SST data from NASA Earth Observation, and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundaries from MarineRegions.org.

The methodology involves conducting Welch’s t-test to determine whether SST has a statistically significant impact on capture production. If a species shows a significant difference in capture production between SST levels, GHMM is applied to model its trends. The model is initially trained on data from 2003 to 2017, evaluated on 2018-2021 data, and then retrained using 2003-2021 data to forecast capture production for 2022.

The results reveal that some species exhibit a strong correlation with SST, while others are minimally affected. GHMM effectively captures production trends for species influenced by SST, with 2022 forecasts aligning closely with actual observed values, demonstrating the model’s reliability. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in optimizing export-import strategies and allocating marine species capture production between local and international markets to maximize economic outcomes.
